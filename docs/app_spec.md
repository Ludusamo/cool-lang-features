## Brendan Horng

### Data
The data that will be stored will be a listing of cool language features.
Some examples of this are:

- Pattern matching
- Immutable data structures
- Reflection
- Homoiconicity

For a given feature, there may be N number of languages that implement this feature.
For each language that implements a feature, an example code snippet will accompany the language as well as notes about its implementation.
